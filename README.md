# Web Proyect

This is just the beginning of a simple web project, unfortunately I am not in the web development major so this project was just a practice but it serves perfectly to show some of the functionalities requested for the job of the major "Technological Foundations of softaware develompent".

The main idea is to make a virtual agenda where users can write down and save all their thoughts or to-do lists and then re-enter to view them from any device.

## Installation


Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install Flask

```
## Usage

run main.py


#returns 'web location'

Go to new user complete the information (the mail dosen't have to be real to be acepted in this point of development)
